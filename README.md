# gitgum

A bunch of git commands with [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) interface. The features are very tailored to the kind of workflows I have, but nothing work-specific is encoded in. Basically if you use the same workflows as me and like bash scripts, this is for you.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/lczyk/gitgum
ln -s "$PWD/gitgum/src/gitgum" ~/.local/bin/gg
```

or something along these lines.

## Other git tools

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - i found myself using it less and less since i wrote gitgum, but its still good.
- [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig) - still getting used to the navigation
