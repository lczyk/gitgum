- Remember to update completions files when implementing / updating new commands.
- Never edit `generated.go` directly.  Edit templates and regenerate.
- Use `github.com/lczyk/assert` package (custom assertion library) for tests.
- Use table-driven tests with subtests for multiple cases
- gitgum uses external `git` command.
- do *NOT* use external "fzf" command. Instead, use the internal Go implementation of fzf.
- we use major.minor.patch versioning. any breaking changes should bump the minor version. any non-breaking changes should bump the patch version. every now and again the major version is bumped manually.
- the go version does not support --dry-run flag
- use makefile target 'test' to run tests
- use makefile target 'build' to build
